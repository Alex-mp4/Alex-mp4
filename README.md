### Welcome to my profile! I go by Alex... but you can call me anytime. Wait, no... please don't leave!

#### About Me
:interrobang: 
- **I am a student** from a moderately sized city in northern Sweden. 
- **Currently affiliated with NTI** and their fourth-year programme.

:bangbang: 
- **UI & UX design is my bread and butter.** That is, if the bread is moldy and the butter out-of-date.
- **Figma and VSCode is also my bread and butter,** but they are comparatively fine.
